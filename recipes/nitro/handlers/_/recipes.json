Add honey and salt; mix to dissolve. Add basil leaves, stir and allow them to wilt in the mixture; remove saucepan from heat.  Pour mixture into a blender and emulsify until completely creamy and no chunks of basil are visible (if this is not possible in your blender you can strain out the basil pieces with a fine wire strainer/colander if you would like or you can leave the basil pieces in the mixture).  Allow mixture to cool 20 minutes; this allows the flavors to infuse.  Pour mixture in a large container and refrigerate a few hours until cool.\nIf using an ice cream maker, follow the instructions on your ice cream maker accordingly (the one I used sits on the counter. You just plug it in, turn it on chill mode, allow the built-in bowl to get cool, then pour in the ice cream mixture. You then turn on the churn setting and turn the timer on for 25 minutes.  It works its magic and you have wonderful ice cream by the time dinner is consumed).\nYou can also try this without an ice cream maker by putting the mixture in a freezer-safe container and stirring with a spoon every hour for roughly 8  10 hours.  If you try this without an ice cream maker, small ice crystals will form and the consistency will not be as creamy as youd get when using an ice cream maker, but it will still be damn delicious!\nSide note: We had leftovers when I made this and we froze them in a Tupperware container. The ice cream gets to be frozen solid so when you go to eat the leftovers, make sure you thaw the ice cream at least 10 minutes before attempting to dig in.","extendedIngredients":[{"id":2044,"name":"basil leaves","image":"fresh-basil.jpg","original":"1-1/2 cups fresh basil leaves (tightly packed)","amount":1.5,"unit":"cups"},{"id":12118,"name":"full-fat coconut milk","image":"coconut-milk.png","original":"2 cans full-fat coconut milk (13.6-ounce cans)","amount":2,"unit":"cans"},{"id":19296,"name":"honey","image":"honey.png","original":"½ cup honey","amount":0.5,"unit":"cup"},{"id":1049,"name":"half & half","image":"fluid-cream.jpg","original":"¾ cup half & half","amount":0.75,"unit":"cup"},{"id":2047,"name":"salt","image":"salt.jpg","original":"1/8 teaspoon salt","amount":0.125,"unit":"teaspoon"}]},{"id":650122,"title":"Linguine and Clams In Garlic White Wine Sauce","image":"https://img.spoonacular.com/recipes/650122-556x370.jpg","readyInMinutes":45,"servings":6,"sourceUrl":"https://www.foodista.com/recipe/RKSQDFS4/linguine-and-clams-in-garlic-white-wine-sauce","summary":"Linguine and Clams In Garlic White Wine Sauce is a <b>pescatarian</b> recipe with 6 servings.

Bring pan to medium high heat and cook until garlic becomes golden brown. (Meg note: I happen to love garlic and flipped the smashed garlic over to brown on the other side, wanting to get as much garlic flavor as I could.) When garlic is golden brown and very aromatic, remove it and discard (it has fulfilled its garlic destiny). Put 3 1/2 dozen clams in the pan and add the wine. Cover the pan a bring to a boil over medium heat. Cover and cook until the clams open up, about 10 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, remove the clams from the pan and set aside. Pour the cooking liquid into a measuring cup and set aside.\nBring a large pot of water to a boil over medium heat. (Meg note: I usually salt my pasta water, but the cooking liquid was on the salty side so I skipped, figuring it is easier to add the salt in later than take it out.)\nMince remaining smashed garlic cloves. Coat same saute pan again with olive oil and add garlic and another pinch of red pepper flakes. Bring pan to medium-high heat and cook garlic for a minute or two (dont let it get brown). Add the remaining raw clams and reserved clam cooking liquid to the pan. When adding the liquid, be sure to check for sand and grit in the bottom, you may lose the last couple of tablespoons of juice but that is better than sand in your pasta! (Meg note: even though I followed the directions, next time I might strain the juice through a paper towel lined sieve to make sure all of the sand and grit is out, before adding it back into the pan.) Cover and cook until the clams open.\nWhile clams are cooking, drop the linguine into the salted boiling water and cook until the pasta is very al dente  maybe a minute or so less than the box directs.\nRemove the cooked clams in their shells from the pan and keep warm. Add the butter and cooked clams that have been removed from their shells back to the pan. Bring the liquid to a boil and toss in the cooked pasta and the herbs. Cook the pasta together with the sauce until the sauce clings to the pasta. Turn off the heat and toss in the grated parmigian-reggiano, if using. Stir vigorously to combine.\nDivide the pasta into serving dishes and garnish with clams that are still in their shells and some chopped herbs.\nNote: Purchase shellfish thats sold in mesh bags. If you buy clams or mussels that are in plastic bags, you may be getting dead shellfish. The plastic makes them suffocate.","extendedIngredients":[{"id":11215,"name":"garlic","image":"garlic.png","original":"10 cloves garlic, smashed","amount":10,"unit":"cloves"},{"id":10015157,"name":"dozens little neck clams","image":"littleneck-clams.jpg","original":"5 dozens little neck clams, scrubbed under cold running water","amount":5,"unit":""},{"id":14106,"name":"white wine","image":"white-wine.jpg","original":"2 cups white wine","amount":2,"unit":"cups"},{"id":1032009,"name":"of pepper flakes","image":"red-pepper-flakes.jpg","original":"2 pinchs large of crushed red pepper flakes","amount":2,"unit":"pinch"},{"id":10720420,"name":"linguine","image":"spaghetti.jpg","original":"1 pound linguine","amount":1,"unit":"pound"},{"id":1145,"name":"butter","image":"butter-sliced.jpg","original":"2 tablespoons unsalted butter","amount":2,"unit":"tablespoons"},{"id":10311297,"name":"parsley","image":"parsley.jpg","original":"2 tablespoons chopped Italian parsley, plus additional for garnish","amount":2,"unit":"tablespoons"},{"id":2027,"name":"oregano leaves","image":"oregano.jpg","original":"2 tablespoons chopped fresh oregano leaves, plus additional for garnish","amount":2,"unit":"tablespoons"},{"id":1033,"name":"parmigiano-reggiano","image":"parmesan.jpg","original":"1 cup finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano, optioinal","amount":1,"unit":"cup"},{"id":1082047,"name":"kosher salt","image":"salt.jpg","original":"Kosher salt (I did not need any)","amount":6,"unit":"servings"}]},{"id":651911,"title":"Minced Beef Curry","image":"https://img.spoonacular.com/recipes/651911-556x370.jpg","readyInMinutes":45,"servings":2,"sourceUrl":"https://www.foodista.com/recipe/7HCZZZLC/minced-beef-curry","summary":"You can never have too many main course recipes, so give Minced Beef Curry a try.

For this you take 1/2 cup of flour and place in a large bowl with the half cup warm water and the yeast. Cover the bowl with plastic and let stand anywhere from 2-8 hours. This is to allow it to ferment, I personally couldn't wait the whole time, I think I made it a minute past the 2 hour mark.\nStir in the 1 cup of water a little at a time. Add in the salt and just enough of the flour to make the dough pull away from the sides of the bowl.\nTurn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead enough flour to make a soft dough. It should be smooth and elastic. Place dough in a lightly oiled bowl, turning to coat the dough ball lightly, and cover. Place in a warm place where a draft cannot get to it and allow to rise about 1 hour.\nPrep a large baking pan (pizza pan works well) by either taking an oiled napkin and running it around the pan or line with parchment paper.\nPunch the dough down and allow to rest 10 minutes.\nOil your hands and place dough in the pan. Brush the top of the dough with oil then, using your fingers, make deep dimples in the dough, about 1/2 inch. Cover with plastic again and let rest in a warm place for 30 minutes.\nPreheat the oven to 400F(200C).\nTake the olives, feta and basil and spread on top of the foccacia. Sprinkle salt on top and place in oven. Bake 18 - 20 minutes  or until golden. Check about half way through and deflate any large bubbles with the poke of a knife.\nWhen done cooking, place on a rack to cool for about 15 - 20 minutes.\nThis bread is very versatile. You can make it into small mini loaves (as in the original recipe) or in a big one like I did. You can also top it with a number of different ingredients, just let your craving drive you :D!","extendedIngredients":[{"id":10020081,"name":"all purpose unbleached flour","image":"flour.png","original":"2 cups (475 ml) all purpose unbleached flour","amount":475,"unit":"ml"},{"id":20080,"name":"flour","image":"flour.png","original":"2 cups (475 ml) whole wheat flour","amount":475,"unit":"ml"},{"id":14412,"name":"warm water","image":"water.png","original":"1/2 cup (130 ml) warm water (warmer than room temp but not warm enough to be uncomfortable to the touch)","amount":130,"unit":"ml"},{"id":18375,"name":"active yeast","image":"yeast-granules.jpg","original":"1/2 package (1 teaspoon/5ml) active dry yeast","amount":0.5,"unit":"package"},{"id":14412,"name":"warm water","image":"water.png","original":"1 cup (235 ml) warm water (same as the first)","amount":235,"unit":"ml"},{"id":2047,"name":"salt","image":"salt.jpg","original":"1 pinch a good of salt","amount":1,"unit":"pinch"},{"id":4053,"name":"olive oil","image":"olive-oil.jpg","original":"1 tablespoon (15 ml) olive oil","amount":15,"unit":"ml"},{"id":9195,"name":"olives","image":"olives-mixed.jpg","original":"sliced olives","amount":8,"unit":"servings"},{"id":1019,"name":"feta","image":"feta.png","original":"crumbled feta","amount":8,"unit":"servings"},{"id":2044,"name":"basil","image":"fresh-basil.jpg","original":"fresh basil, cut into thin ribbons","amount":8,"unit":"servings"},{"id":2047,"name":"course salt","image":"salt.jpg","original":"of course salt","amount":8,"unit":"servings"}]},{"id":637008,"title":"Caramel ice cream","image":"https://img.spoonacular.com/recipes/637008-556x370.jpg","readyInMinutes":45,"servings":6,"sourceUrl":"https://www.foodista.com/recipe/3PMCPVCX/caramel-ice-cream","summary":"You can never have too many dessert recipes, so give Caramel ice cream a try.

In a large bowl sift together flours, sugar and salt. Cut the butter into small pieces and add to the bowl. Rub the butter into the flour mixture with your hands until the pieces are small but still visible.\nAdd oil and yogurt to the bowl and stir with a fork to combine. Knead the dough for one minute in a bowl. It will still be fairly crumbly. Transfer to a floured surface and continue to knead until you can form a ball of dough. Divide the dough in half and flatten into two discs. Wrap in cellophane and refrigerate at least one hour.\nWhile the dough chills, create the filling. Add all ingredients to a food processor and pulse until smooth. Refrigerate until ready to use.\nPreheat oven to 400. Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper and set aside.\nWhen the dough is chilled, remove from the fridge and unwrap. Flour a large, smooth surface. Roll both balls of dough until they are each about  inch thick. Use a cookie cutter to cut heart shapes or use a biscuit cutter/large glass to cut circles.\nPlace half of the pie hearts onto the prepared cookie sheet and add one teaspoon of pie filling to the centre of each one.\nI added personalized messages to each pie using letter stamps I bought at a craft store. I stamped love be mine and honey on the heart shaped dough that would act as the tops of the pies.\nWet your finger and paint it along the edges of each cut out. Place a second dough heart on top of the filling and press down along the edges to secure.\nUse the tines of a fork and press down along the edges to contain the pie filling. Brush a small amount of egg white on the top of each pie. This will give a nice golden colour to the pies.\nBake for 20 minutes.\nMakes 10-12 mini pies (depending on the size of your cookie cutter.

Drain and set aside. In a large bowl put your chopped bacon, green onions, shredded cheese, mix well.\nIn a medium bowl put your eggs, salt, peppers, flour, mayo and milk beat well. I used an immersion blender for the mayo tends to 'seize in little pieces from the cold milk. The immersion blender made it all smooth.\nUnroll your phyllo dough and cover with a damp paper towel. Either grease your 8 inch springform pan with cooking spray or melted butter. Uncover your dough and remove two sheets of phyllo (replacing the damp towel) and lay into your springform pan. Take your pastry brush and coat it with butter. Making sure the phyllo 'sticks' to the sides. Rotate pan a bit and repeat with two more layers and butter. Keep rotating and layering and buttering until you have quite a thick 'phyllo' nest. Roughly about 3/4 of the roll. Since there are 20 sheets to a roll and you are putting down 2 layers at a time; this will be about 14-16 sheets)\nSince your broccoli is cool now, roughly chop it and mix it in with the bacon and cheese mixture. Put the broccoli/bacon/cheese mix into your phyllo nest and gently pat down. Remix your egg mixture (pepper and flour may settle a bit) and pour over your broccoli mixture.\nTake your remaining phyllo sheets and put on top 2 layers at a time coating with butter in between. Roll your over hanging edges with the phyllo sides to create a 'crust edge'. Brush top with butter.\nBake in 350 degree oven for 1 hour and 15 minutes. You may need to cover the phyllo after an hour to keep it from overbrowning. Let sit 15 minutes before cutting (you don't want everything to ooze out on you).\nBe careful cutting very gently so you don't MASSACRE your phyllo dough. Use a serrated knife and gently saw. When you get to the bottom where the phyllo is more thick....you don't have to be so gentle.","extendedIngredients":[{"id":98938,"name":"broccoflower","image":"romanesco.png","original":"1 head of broccoflower, cut into 'florettes'","amount":1,"unit":"head"},{"id":1123,"name":"eggs","image":"egg.png","original":"4 eggs","amount":4,"unit":""},{"id":10862,"name":"bacon","image":"cooked-bacon.jpg","original":"8 strips of bacon, cooked and chopped","amount":8,"unit":"strips"},{"id":2047,"name":"salt","image":"salt.jpg","original":"1/2 teaspoon salt","amount":0.5,"unit":"teaspoon"},{"id":20081,"name":"flour","image":"flour.png","original":"3 teaspoons flour","amount":3,"unit":"teaspoons"},{"id":1077,"name":"milk","image":"milk.png","original":"1 cup milk","amount":1,"unit":"cup"},{"id":1085,"name":"mayo","image":"img.spoonacular.","original":"2 tablespoons of mayo (I used this since I was using skim milk)","amount":2,"unit":"tablespoons"},{"id":11291,"name":"green onions","image":"spring-onions.jpg","original":"1/4 cup green onions, chopped","amount":0.25,"unit":"cup"},{"id":2031,"name":"cayenne","image":"chili-powder.jpg","original":"dash of cayenne","amount":1,"unit":"dash"},{"id":1002030,"name":"pepper","image":"pepper.jpg","original":"1/2 teaspoon pepper","amount":0.5,"unit":"teaspoon"},{"id":1001009,"name":"cheddar cheese","image":"shredded-cheddar.jpg","original":"1/2 pound smoked cheddar cheese, shredded","amount":0.5,"unit":"pound"},{"id":18338,"name":"phyllo dough sheets","image":"filo-dough.png","original":"1/2 inch package of phyllo dough sheets (1 of the 2 cylinders the box), at room temperature","amount":0.5,"unit":"inch"},{"id":1053,"name":"may not be heavy handed","image":"fluid-cream.jpg","original":"7 tablespoons butter, melted (you may or may not be heavy handed with this)","amount":7,"unit":"tablespoons"}]},{"id":651455,"title":"Mediterranean-Style Haddock","image":"https://img.spoonacular.com/recipes/651455-556x370.jpg","readyInMinutes":45,"servings":2,"sourceUrl":"https://www.foodista.com/recipe/KQWX4NZT/mediterranean-style-haddock","summary":"Mediterranean-Style Haddock might be just the main course you are searching for.
