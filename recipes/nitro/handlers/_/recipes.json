Select firm, meaty peppers without wrinkles for roasting. Wash thoroughly. Place peppers evenly in a single layer on a foil-lined cookie sheet. Place under broiler. Watch them closely as the skin will blister and turn black within minutes. Turn the peppers after 5 minutes to blister all sides evenly. When done, the pepper skins should be evenly blistered and mostly black. Place roasted peppers in a plastic bag, cover with a kitchen towel and when cool, rub off blackened skin. Tear open and pull out the seed pod and stem.\nSauce\nIn a blender combine the peppers, flour, and half of the suero or buttermilk and blend until creamy. Pour mixture into medium skillet and set over medium-low heat to warm. Add additional suero or buttermilk and stir. Taste and season with salt, usually about 2 teaspoons. If the sauce is too spicy, add  cup of crema or sour cream and stir. If the sauce is too thick, add water until desired consistency is reached.\nChicken (Optional)\nIn a pot with enough water to cover, boil chicken breasts 25 minutes or until juices run clear.

Soften tortillas by soaking in sauce one at a time. Place softened tortillas on individual serving plates. Layer with cooked chicken, cheese, and onion. Repeat process for a total of 3 tortillas for each serving.\nOven Style\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees. Spread 1 cup of the sauce in an ungreased 9-by-13-inch baking dish. Fry tortillas in hot oil just until softened. Drain on paper towels. Fill with cooked chicken, cheese, and onion. Roll, placing seam side down.\nPour 2 cups of the sauce over enchiladas.

You could stem the swiss chard entirely. I like leaving a bit of stem with the leaves to give better structure to the wraps.\nChop the cauliflower into small pieces and pulse them in a food processor until it looks like rice. I usually pulse the cauliflower florets and the stalk together.\nPlace the olive oil in a saut pan over medium-high heat. Once the pan is hot, add the garlic and let it fry for about a minute or two, or until the garlic starts to brown. Add the pulsed cauliflower rice and cook it for about 2-3 minutes. The cauliflower should turn into a vibrant yellow-orange color when it is cooked. Add a pinch of salt and chopped basil to the cauliflower and stir.\nSpiralize the zucchini with Blade B to create zucchini noodles. If you do not have a spiralizer, just create zucchini ribbons with a vegetable peeler.\nTo assemble the wraps, place a large leaf flat down. Add a bit of sauted cauliflower, zucchini noodles, red pepper, and avocado along the swiss chard stalk.

Add in the radish and cucumber slices, arugula and toss together.\nFor the scallops: heat oil in a high heat. Place the scallops flat-side down in the hot pan.

If you give in to the temptation to move the scallops around the pan, all you'll be doing is preventing them from forming the nice brown crust that you want. Because of variations in scallop thickness, pan temperatures and so on, it's not easy to pinpoint an exact cooking time. But after a couple of minutes, it's OK to peek underneath. If you see a nice, caramel-colored crust on the underside, they're ready to flip.\nPlate your salad and place 4 scallops on top.

Set aside.\nTo make the sauce:\nCut the top of the dried chili and shake out the seeds. Transfer them into a saucepan along with the prunes, broth, tomatoes, tomato paste, onion, molasses, garlic, pumpkin seeds, cumin, and oregano. Bring the mixture to a boil over high heat and cook for 2 minutes; then lower the heat to a simmer and cook for 20 minutes more.\nUsing an immersion blender, puree the mixture until completely smooth. Return to the heat and simmer, uncovered, for another 15 to 20 minutes. (If you dont have an immersion blender, carefully ladle the sauce into a food processor, and process until smooth, working in batches; then return to the pot.) Set the sauce aside until ready to serve with the corndogs, or if you are making this ahead of time, once the sauce has cooled, transfer it to a container and refrigerate.\nTo prepare the corn dogs:\nIn a mixing bowl, combine the masa harina, cornmeal,  cup of the rice flour, baking powder, brown sugar, and salt and mix to combine. Add the eggs, one at a time, mixing well to combine. Add the rice milk and lime juice and mix to combine. The mixture should resemble a thick pancake batter; if more milk is needed, add by the tablespoonful. Cover and refrigerate the mixture if you are not going to be frying right away.\nWhen you are ready to cook, heat the oil in a saucepan until it registers 350F on a deep-frying thermometer. While the oil is heating, place the remaining rice flour on a paper plate and set aside. Cut each chicken sausage in half crosswise, to make eight pieces.\nRoll each piece of sausage in the rice flour to lightly coat. Thread the moistened bamboo skewers through the sausage pieces, so that the tips of the skewers are not quite poking out the top. Holding it by its skewer, dip a floured sausage piece into the batter, until it is completely coated. Carefully lift the stick and hold it over the bowl for a few seconds, allowing any excess batter to drip off. Repeat with another skewer. Carefully place two corn dogs into the hot oil and cook until they are crusty on the outside, and dark golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Drain on paper towels and keep warm. Repeat with each skewered sausage, allowing the oil to return to 350F in between. Serve immediately with the chili.","extendedIngredients":[{"id":10211962,"name":"ancho chili pepper","image":"dried-arbol-chiles.jpg","original":"1 ancho chili pepper","amount":1,"unit":""},{"id":9291,"name":"prunes","image":"prunes.jpg","original":"2 large pitted prunes","amount":2,"unit":"large"},{"id":10093741,"name":"beef broth","image":"beef-broth.png","original":"1 cup low-sodium chicken or beef broth","amount":1,"unit":"cup"},{"id":98849,"name":"fire-roasted tomatoes","image":"tomatoes-canned.png","original":"1 cup fire-roasted tomatoes","amount":1,"unit":"cup"},{"id":11887,"name":"tomato paste","image":"tomato-paste.jpg","original":"¼ cup tomato paste","amount":0.25,"unit":"cup"},{"id":11282,"name":"onion","image":"brown-onion.png","original":"1 small onion, peeled cut into quarters","amount":1,"unit":"small"},{"id":19304,"name":"molasses","image":"molasses.jpg","original":"1 teaspoon molasses","amount":1,"unit":"teaspoon"},{"id":11215,"name":"garlic","image":"garlic.png","original":"2 cloves garlic, peeled","amount":2,"unit":"cloves"},{"id":12016,"name":"pumpkin seeds","image":"pumpkin-seeds.jpg","original":"¼ cup raw, unsalted pumpkin seeds","amount":0.25,"unit":"cup"},{"id":1012014,"name":"ground cumin","image":"ground-cumin.jpg","original":"1 teaspoon ground cumin","amount":1,"unit":"teaspoon"},{"id":2027,"name":"oregano","image":"oregano.jpg","original":"1 teaspoon fresh oregano","amount":1,"unit":"teaspoon"},{"id":20317,"name":"masa harina","image":"corn-flour.jpg","original":"½ cup masa harina, Masabrosa preferred (see Kitchen Tip #1)","amount":0.5,"unit":"cup"},{"id":35137,"name":"cornmeal","image":"cornmeal.png","original":"¼ cup stone-ground cornmeal","amount":0.25,"unit":"cup"},{"id":20061,"name":"rice flour","image":"white-powder.jpg","original":"1 cup rice flour, divided","amount":1,"unit":"cup"},{"id":18369,"name":"baking powder","image":"white-powder.jpg","original":"1 teaspoon baking powder","amount":1,"unit":"teaspoon"},{"id":19334,"name":"brown sugar","image":"dark-brown-sugar.png","original":"2 tablespoons brown sugar","amount":2,"unit":"tablespoons"},{"id":1082047,"name":"kosher salt","image":"salt.jpg","original":"½ teaspoon kosher salt","amount":0.5,"unit":"teaspoon"},{"id":1123,"name":"eggs","image":"egg.png","original":"2 large eggs","amount":2,"unit":"large"},{"id":9160,"name":"juice of lime","image":"lime-juice.png","original":"Juice of 1 lime","amount":1,"unit":""},{"id":93761,"name":"rice milk","image":"rice-milk.png","original":"½ cup plus 2 tablespoons rice milk","amount":0.5,"unit":"cup"},{"id":1014582,"name":"canola oil","image":"vegetable-oil.jpg","original":"5 cups peanut or canola oil","amount":5,"unit":"cups"},{"id":93668,"name":"spicy chicken sausage links","image":"chicken-or-turkey-sausage.jpg","original":"4 spicy cooked chicken sausage links","amount":4,"unit":""}]},{"id":663985,"title":"Turkey and Rice Stuffed Acorn Squash","image":"https://img.spoonacular.com/recipes/663985-556x370.jpg","readyInMinutes":45,"servings":6,"sourceUrl":"https://www.foodista.com/recipe/8QRN8DXZ/turkey-and-rice-stuffed-acorn-squash","summary":"Turkey and Rice Stuffed Acorn Squash is a main course that serves 6.

I peel and mince 4 cloves of garlic.\nAlong with a few glugs of EVOO, some sea salt, and some cracked black pepper, I mix all this savory yumyum into a paste in a bowl.\nThen I spread it liberally along what will be the inside of my meat-wad.  See the strings laid out below?  Im going to fold this slab in half, encasing my herbaliciousness in the inside.\nSee?  I slide this baby into a ziplock bag and set it in the fridge to marinate for a few hours (overnight will work, too).  Its going to take at least 2 hours to roast, so I take it out around 4:00 pm\nAnd get my roasting pan set to high heat with a few glugs of EVOO shimmering on the surface.\nIm going to sear every surface of my luscious wrapped pink pig, which will help it cook through to tender later.  I leave the fat-cap for last.  Bottoms down!\nThen cut side, using tongs to flip when the surface has caramelized to a lovely golden brown.\nI even brown each tip, like so.\nFinally, I press the sweet sweet slice of quivering pork skin onto the searing hot oiled surface of my pan. After a few moments, I flip it the final time.\nThe house has already started to spell amazing, and the beautiful bacony aromas released once fat hits heat is almost more than I can handle.  Almost.  The promise of porcine perfection to come keeps me in check.\nOh, Ive nestled a few thick slices of white onion under my pork roast, because I dont want the bottom to oversear before the meat can release some juices, and then I dont want the bottom to stew in those juices too much.  The onion elevates the roast while adding flavor.  I wrap this in foil paper, and set into a\nOven.  It will bake for at least 2 hours; larger roasts will take longer, but for 2 people this is just the right size, and just the right amount of time to inhale the noxious tantalizing aromas before some sort of crazy sets in.\nI make my cucumber yoghurt right away, because I want the flavors to blend.  I start my peeling, then slicing\nThen chopping my cucumber.\nI throw it into a bowl, along with my yoghurt, 2 cloves of minced garlic, some lemon zest, the juice of 1/2 that lemon, some sea salt, cracked black pepper\nAnd I mix it all well.  I set this in the fridge, so all the flavors can come together.  Which they do oh, baby they do.\nWhen my roast is almost done (pretty much right at the 1:45 mark), I prep my spuds by splitting them into quarters, and tossing them with lots of EVOO, sea salt, cracked black pepper, and another 1/2 cup of chopped fresh rosemary and oregano.  Were bringing the scent and savory of the pork and potatoes together by lacing them both with the same herb blend.\nI spread these out on a sheet pan, and give them another healthy dose of EVOO, just to be sure theyre very heartily coated.  I set this into the bottom shelf of my oven, right above the heating element, so that my edges will crust up nicely. Youll see.\nWe purchased this lovely bottle of oregano scented white balsamic vinegar at O&Co. on Newbury Street.  Tonight was the perfect time to break it out.  Have you ever had french fries with vinegar?  If not, I highly recommend it.  This is the same concept.\nI had set aside the large bowl in which Id tossed my spuds; it was still coated with residual herbed EVOO, salt, and pepper.  Ive sliced my white onions into strips, and I toss them into this reservoir with another few healthy glugs of oil, and another handful of oregano leaves.  Heres where my vinegar comes in; I douse a healthy serving over this beautiful blend, stirring it all up very very well, soaking each each crisp slice of white root with dressing.  Every few minutes or so, I toss it afresh; this reactive base quick-pickles my onion slices transforming the flavor from pungent to perky sweet.\nFor the last 10 minutes of cooking my roast, I remove the foil from the top to expose the skin to the heat.  I can easily twist a wee bit of meat off with my fork, letting me know it is tender and perfectly ready to serve. I set the heat to 425, then stick my roast back in the oven so the skin can crisp.\nMeanwhile, my onions have pickled\nAnd Ive layered my baby spinach over them\nBefore I pour my spuds, sizzling oil and seared spices and all, over the whole pan.\nI toss this very well, letting the hot potatoes and oil wilt my spinach, and blending the pickled onions over the whole batch.\nMy pork is ready to go: the fat cap is crisped and blistered, and the meat is fork-tender.\nThis hunk of lovemeat almost slices itself, and the herbage cleavage is like a vein of precious green flavor gold.\nTopped with a cool cucumber cream, my thick, tender  slabs of herbed rolled pork roast with crispy, savory skin are perfectly partnered with my snappy spuds and buttery greens.  This is an elegant, delicious dinner that welcomes the first breezes of early spring  through freshly re-opened windows.  Light, fresh, and fantastic: I wish I could have you all over for dinner, because this was a company meal!","extendedIngredients":[{"id":10084,"name":"butterflies pork butt","image":"boston-butt-or-pork-butt.png","original":"2 1/2 pounds boneless butterflies pork butt or shoulder","amount":2.5,"unit":"pounds"},{"id":2027,"name":"oregano","image":"oregano.jpg","original":"fresh oregano","amount":10,"unit":"servings"},{"id":2063,"name":"rosemary","image":"rosemary.jpg","original":"fresh rosemary","amount":10,"unit":"servings"},{"id":11215,"name":"garlic","image":"garlic.png","original":"fresh garlic","amount":10,"unit":"servings"},{"id":11457,"name":"baby spinach","image":"spinach.jpg","original":"1 pound baby spinach","amount":1,"unit":"pound"},{"id":10011355,"name":"potatoes","image":"red-potatoes.jpg","original":"1 pound small red potatoes","amount":1,"unit":"pound"},{"id":10611282,"name":"onions","image":"white-onion.png","original":"3 medium white onions","amount":3,"unit":"medium"},{"id":1034053,"name":"evoo","image":"olive-oil.jpg","original":"EVOO","amount":10,"unit":"servings"},{"id":1012069,"name":"balsamic vinegar","image":"vinegar-(white).jpg","original":"white balsamic vinegar","amount":10,"unit":"servings"},{"id":1256,"name":"greek yoghurt","image":"plain-yogurt.jpg","original":"Greek yoghurt","amount":10,"unit":"servings"},{"id":11206,"name":"cucumber","image":"cucumber.jpg","original":"1 medium cucumber","amount":1,"unit":"medium"},{"id":9150,"name":"lemon","image":"lemon.png","original":"1 lemon","amount":1,"unit":""},{"id":1002030,"name":"sea salt","image":"pepper.jpg","original":"sea salt, cracked black pepper","amount":10,"unit":"servings"}]},{"id":640336,"title":"Crabby Corn Chowder","image":"https://img.spoonacular.com/recipes/640336-556x370.jpg","readyInMinutes":45,"servings":6,"sourceUrl":"https://www.foodista.com/recipe/L6JLY36Q/crabby-corn-chowder","summary":"Need a <b>pescatarian main course</b>?

It is important to get the oil nice and hot (not smoking, just before that point) your shrimp should sizzle when added to the pan. Check the back of the shrimp and when you see the colour change about half way up, turn them over. Do the same on the other side. This should only take a minute to two minutes maximum on both sides  otherwise you will get a rubbery result if you leave it too long. Squeeze over the lime juice  this too should bubble and reduce. Add a little salt and pepper, stir through, remove from the heat and set aside.\n2.Mix the dressing ingredients together, check for flavour, adjust if need be and set aside.\n3.Place all the salad ingredients in a bowl except the avocado and the salt and pepper. Prepare the avocado as you are about to serve otherwise it will turn brown. Once it is covered in the lime dressing, this will slow down the oxidization process and it wont go brown so easily.\n4.When you are ready to serve mix  of the avocado through the salad and add the dressing. Toss everything together. Taste to see if you need any salt and pepper. Place your shrimp on top of the salad with the rest of the avocado and sprinkle/pour any residue from the pan over your salad in which you cooked the shrimp. This is great flavour, so you dont want to lose it.","extendedIngredients":[{"id":15270,"name":"the shrimp","image":"shrimp.png","original":"The Shrimp","amount":4,"unit":"servings"},{"id":10015243,"name":"shrimp","image":"langoustine-or-prawns.jpg","original":"About 600gr of large tiger style shrimp (prawns/langoustine) peeled and cleaned","amount":600,"unit":"gr"},{"id":10211215,"name":"garlic cloves","image":"garlic.jpg","original":"2 x garlic cloves, crushed","amount":2,"unit":""},{"id":4053,"name":"olive oil","image":"olive-oil.jpg","original":"1 x tbsp olive oil","amount":1,"unit":"tbsp"},{"id":9160,"name":"juice of lime","image":"lime-juice.png","original":"Juice of 1 lime","amount":1,"unit":""},{"id":1102047,"name":"salt and pepper","image":"salt-and-pepper.jpg","original":"Salt and Pepper","amount":4,"unit":"servings"},{"id":21052,"name":"the salad","image":"mixed-greens-or-mesclun.jpg","original":"The Salad","amount":4,"unit":"servings"},{"id":10111251,"name":"the of 1 cos lettuce","image":"romaine.jpg","original":"The leaves of 1 medium Cos lettuce finely shredded","amount":1,"unit":"leaves"},{"id":2044,"name":"basil leaves","image":"basil.jpg","original":"6/8 basil leaves chopped","amount":0.75,"unit":""},{"id":10111168,"name":"corn","image":"corn.png","original":"200gr sweet corn","amount":200,"unit":"gr"},{"id":11291,"name":"spring onions","image":"spring-onions.jpg","original":"3 x spring onions (scallions) chopped finely","amount":3,"unit":""},{"id":9266,"name":"pineapple","image":"pineapple.jpg","original":"600gr fresh pineapple cut into small cubes","amount":600,"unit":"gr"},{"id":9037,"name":"avocados into cubes","image":"avocado.jpg","original":"2 x avocados chopped into cubes","amount":2,"unit":""},{"id":9037,"name":"avocado","image":"avocado.jpg","original":"Avocado","amount":4,"unit":"servings"},{"id":43016,"name":"the dressing","image":"coleslaw-or-caesar-dressing.jpg","original":"The Dressing","amount":4,"unit":"servings"},{"id":4053,"name":"tbsp olive oil","image":"olive-oil.jpg","original":"3 x tbsp olive oil","amount":3,"unit":""},{"id":19296,"name":"tbsp honey","image":"honey.png","original":"3 x tbsp honey","amount":3,"unit":""},{"id":9160,"name":"juice of lime","image":"lime-juice.png","original":"Juice and zest of 3 limes","amount":3,"unit":""}]},{"id":664473,"title":"Vegan Peanut Butter Chocolate Fudge","image":"https://img.spoonacular.com/recipes/664473-556x370.jpg","readyInMinutes":45,"servings":6,"sourceUrl":"https://www.foodista.com/recipe/QJR5QH5F/vegan-peanut-butter-chocolate-fudge","summary":"Vegan Peanut Butter Chocolate Fudge takes about <b>45 minutes</b> from beginning to end.
